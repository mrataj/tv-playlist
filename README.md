# TV Playlist

This is a playlist of TV and radio channels which are usually served by Slovenian TV providers.
For each TV channel it contains the info about its group, title, ID (for guide) and logo.

The list is optimized to work with [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/), but it works also with other programs, like [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) for example.

Streaming by [MobiaTV](https://www.a1.si/televizija/dodatne-tv-storitve/mobiatv).
